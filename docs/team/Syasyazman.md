## Project: LogOnce

LogOnce is a one-stop logistics tracker app for clerks to monitor shipping statuses of all clients and perform common 
logistics operations. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a 
Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Delete Client
  [\#155](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/155)
  [\#79](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/79)
  [\#71](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/71)
  [\#43](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/43)
  * What it does: allows the user to delete a client from the client list along with all orders in the order list that
  are linked to that client
  * Justification: This feature enhances the delete function as users will not need to manually delete orders made by a
  certain client when the company wishes to cease collaborations or connections with the client.
  * Highlights: This affects commands to be added in the future. The delete functionality is changed to be tailored to
  a unique client ID system instead of ID detection via displayed index of the client list.

* **New Feature**: Delete Order
  [\#155](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/155)
  [\#43](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/43)
  * What it does: Similar to delete client, it allows the user to delete an order from the order list.
  * Justification: This feature helps to differentiate deletion of orders from client. Users can delete individual 
  orders without having to delete the client who made the order and other important orders linked to that client.
  * Highlights: This enhancement follows a unique order ID system which is different from the unique client ID system so
  that the Client and Order deletion will not have unexpected dependencies in future command implementations.
