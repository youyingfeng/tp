## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-client --client 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete-client --client 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-client --client 1` Command](images/DeleteClientSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Client` references. <This>                                                            </This> allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### User Interface

#### Proposed implementation

The updated user interface has three columns: the leftmost column acts as a navigation menu, the middle column displays 
the list of Clients/Orders and the rightmost column is supposed to display more details about the Client/Order.

The switching of views is done by calling methods defined in MainWindow from the FXML file, upon clicking on the 
respective button. These methods are exposed in the `MainWindow` class as `handleClients()` and `handleOrders()`.

_{Diagram will be added at a later date}_

Step 1. The user launches the application, and the User Interface is created.

Step 2. The user clicks on the `Orders` button in order to view the orders. The button will call the function 
`handleOrders()`, causing the view in the middle column to display the list of Orders.

Step 2. The user clicks on the `Clients` button in order to view the clients. The button will call the function 
`handleClients()`, causing the view in the middle column to display the list of Clients.

Step 3. The user clicks on the `Help` button in order to find the link to the user guide. The button will call the 
function `handleHelp()`, which will open a dialog box with the link to the user guide.

Step 4. The user clicks on the `Exit` button in order to close the application. The button will call the function 
`handleExit`, which will close the application.

### User Interface: Information panels

Information panels function by taking in an object (`Client` or `Order`) and displaying its information. It provides buttons to do simple actions (e.g. mark an `Order` as done, edit the `Order`/`Client`, and delete the `Order`/`Client`).

The buttons in the information panels communicate with the MainWindow through JavaFX events. When a button is clicked, it fires off a specific event, which is bubbled up to the parent nodes of the information panel. Eventually, the event will reach the MainWindow, where the event will be picked up by the event handlers set in the MainWindow. The MainWindow will then execute actions based on the type of events specified.

Step 1: The information panel is accessed via the user interface. An object is passed to a new instance of the panel, which will convert all the data in the object to a displayable format.

Step 2: The user clicks on the `Done` button to mark an order as complete (`Orders` only). Upon the click, the button will fire off an `OrderCompleteEvent`, which contains the order being marked as complete. The event will be bubbled up and picked up by the event handlers set in the MainWindow, which will then convert this event to a parseable command and execute it.

Step 3: The user clicks on the `Edit` button to modify the Client/Order. Upon the click, the button will fire off an `EditClientEvent()`/`EditOrderEvent()` which contains the specific Client/Order to be edited, which will be bubbled up to the MainWindow and handled there.

Upon receipt of the event, the MainWindow will take the Client/Order wrapped in the event and pass it to a new instance of an EditClientForm/EditOrderForm. It will then clear the side panel and set this form as the child, to replace the view with the view of the form.

Step 4: The user clicks on the `Delete` button in order to delete the Client/Order. Upon clicking, the information panel will generate a command to be executed, and pass the command to a new instance of `DeletionEvent`, which will be fired off.

When this event is bubbled up and captured by the MainWindow, the MainWindow will take the command string wrapped inside the DeletionEvent and execute it.

### User Interface: Forms

Communication between the forms and the user interface is achieves in one of two ways: the first way is through passing the MainWindow object to the creation form, and the second is through using JavaFX's inbuilt event messaging system to pass commands up to the MainWindow, where they will be executed by the handlers.

#### Method 1: by passing the MainWindow object directly
This method is only used by the client creation form `NewClientForm`.

Step 1: User accesses the form through the user interface.

Step 2: User fills in the text fields with the corresponding information.

Step 3: User clicks `Create`. The form will first conduct rudimentary validation checks on the data (primarily to check for nulls and empty fields). 

If the rudimentary checks fail, the form will update the error message display fields to show the relevant error messages.

Once these checks are done, the form will concatenate the content of the fields into a parseable `client` command, and pass it to the MainWindow to be executed.

Step 4: User clicks `Clear`. The form will clear all text in the text fields.

#### Method 2: by messaging the MainWindow through JavaFX events
This method is used in all other forms (both creation and update).

Step 1: User accesses the form through the user interface

Step 2: User fills in the text fields with the corresponding information.

Step 3: User clicks `Create`/`Submit`. The form will first conduct rudimentary validation checks on the data (primarily to check for nulls and empty fields). 

If these rudimentary checks fail, the form will update the error message display fields to show the relevant error messages.

Once these checks are done, the form will concatenate the content of the fields into a parseable `client` command, and pass it to the MainWindow to be executed.

Step 4: User clicks `Clear` (creation forms only). The form will clear all text in the text fields.

Step 5: User clicks `Reset` (update forms only). The form will reset the text in the text fields to the original text of the `Client` or `Order` being updated.

### Find feature

The find mechanism is facilitated by `FindCommand`, `FindCommandParser`, `FindOrderCommand` and `FindOrderCommandParser`. `FindCommandParser` and `FindOrderCommandParser` implement `Parser`.
`FindCommand` and `FindOrderCommand` extend `Command`.

These two commands allows the user to search for `Clients` and `Orders` by the name or description respectively.

Currently, the search operations for both `Clients` and `Orders` are very similar. Given a command (e.g. `find adam jane` or `findorder iPhone iPad`), the command is processed by `AddressBookParser` and
passed to the corresponding parsers. There, the parser will process the given arguments and will search for all `Clients`/`Orders` whose name or description contain any
of the keywords give. For example, If there were two clients, one named 'Adam' and one named 'Jane', both clients will show up in the search results.

The parsers will split the provided search terms into an array, and match them with client names or order descriptions through the use of streams. The current implementation of `FindOrderCommand`
and `FindOrderCommandParser` are simply adapted from the `FindCommand` and `FindCommandParser` respectively. This was done to ensure a minimally functional feature
Thus, tokens are currently unused for more specific searches.

\[Proposed enhancements\]:

* Usage of optional tokens such as `--date`, `--address`, `--email` to narrow down search range. It will be implemented similarly (by matching keywords). A client or an order
must match at least one of the keywords in each category in order to be shown in the search results. The list of clients/orders will be converted
into a stream and be filtered by multiple predicates, each corresponding to a data field within `Client`/`Order`.

* A further enhncement would be to reduce the strictness of the token search. Instead of having to match at least one keyword from each category,
any keyword match in any category would allow for the order or client to show up in the search results. This will be done by maintaining different filtered lists and combining them
while ignoring duplicates.

Given below are examples of usage scenarios and how the two commands behave at each step

_{Diagram will be added at a later date}_

### Delete Feature

The delete mechanism is split into two functionalities - `Delete Order` and `Delete Client`.

The delete mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteOrderCommand`, `DeleteOrderCommandParser`, `DeleteClientCommand`, 
`DeleteClientCommandParser`, `AddressBook` and `ModelManager`. 

`DeleteOrderCommand` and `DeleteClientCommand` extends `Command`, `DeleteOrderCommandParser` and 
`DeleteClientCommandParser` implements `Parser`, `AddressBook` implements `ReadOnlyAddressBook` and `ModelManager` 
implements `Model`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deletePerson()` and `Model#deleteOrder()`. They are also
exposed in the `AddressBook` class as `AddressBook#removeClient()` and `AddressBook#removeOrder()`.

the `Delete Order` and `Delete Client` differs such that `Delete Order` is dependent on `Delete Client`. This is the 
most distinctive difference where deleting a client from the client list will delete some orders from the order 
list too.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete mechanism behaves at each step.

**Delete Order**

Step 1. The user launches application and views his/her list of orders. In this scenario, the order list is empty.

Step 2. The user executes `order --description 123 --client 1 --address 123 --date 2020-12-12 2359`. An order is created
 and appended to the end of the order list.

Step 3. The user decides to remove the order he had just created. The user notes that the unique order ID of the order 
is `#00001`. The user executes `delete-order --order 1` to remove the order from the order list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete order operation works :

![Delete Order Sequence Diagram](images/DeleteOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

**Delete Client**

Step 1. The user launches application and views his/her list of clients. In this scenario, the client list is empty.

Step 2. The user executes `client --name john --address 123 --email john@gmail.com --phone 12345678`. A client is 
created and appended to the end of the client list.

Step 3. The user decides to remove the client he had just created. The user notes that the unique client ID of the 
client is `#00001`. The user executes `delete-client --client 1` to remove the client from the client list.

Step 4. When user deletes the client, all orders from the order list that are linked to the client will also be deleted.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete client operation works :

![Delete Client Sequence Diagram](images/DeleteClientSequenceDiagram.png)

\[Proposed Enhancements\]

Allow user to delete clients and orders based on specific tokens. For example, a client can be deleted as long as all 
relevant tokens (i.e `name`, `address`, `email`, `phone`) are identified correctly and matches a client in the client 
list. Similarly, delete-order can receive `description`, `client`, `address`, `date` in order to delete a specific 
order.

Although the mentioned enhancement might be slower than the original delete commands, it may be useful for very long 
client or order lists, where it is time consuming to scroll through the lists in order to find a client or order's 
unqiue ID. Accepting the mentioned tokens would be beneficial if user already has the specific client details at hand.

Another enhancement would be to allow `delete-order` to delete all orders linked to a specific client ID. This would 
allow the user to clear all orders under a client without having to delete the client itself.

### List Feature

The list mechanism is split into two functionalities - `List Order` and `List Client`.

These two commands allows the user to list the `Clients` and `Orders` present in the system respectively.

The list mechanism is facilitated by `ListCommand`, `ListOrderCommand`, `Model`, `ModelManager` and `AddressBook`.

`ListCommand` and `ListOrderCommand` extends `Command`. `AddressBook` implements `ReadOnlyAddressBook` and `ModelManager` implements `Model`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `getFilteredOrderList()` and `getFilteredPersonList()`. They are also exposed in the `AddressBook` as `getOrderList` and `getPersonList`.

\[Proposed enhancements\]:
* Use `list` to display the orders of each client in the same panel. 

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the list mechanism behaves at each step.

_{Diagrams will be added at a later date}_

### Undo Feature

The undo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()` and `Model#undoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. 

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()` or `Model#undoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete-client`, just save the client being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Update-client feature

The Update-client mechanism is facilitated by `UpdateClientCommand` and `UpdateClientCommandParser`. `UpdateClientCommandParser` implement `Parser`.
`UpdateClientCommand` extend `Command`.

This command allows the user to update an existing `Client` by their index.

The parser will split the provided terms into an array, obtain what field is to be updated (`Name`, `Address`, `Email`, `Phone`) and obtain the field that is to be updated.

Upon calling the `Execute` method in UpdateClientCommand, the model is queried to obtain the list of clients. From this list, the client is obtained, removed and a new client with the updated field is added into the same index as the deleted client.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Allows for convenient and fast generation of internal documents for archiving for the logistics clerk.

The application would speed up their work as they would no longer need to fill up separate forms (invoices, 
shipping manifests etc) with overlapping data as it would now be automated, thus increasing productivity. 
The product will be a base application that can be customized to fit different company standards.
